For this question, we were given a 2D design space of 150cm x 50cm, a rigid bar of a fixed length, 3 pin supports (two of which must be mounted on the ground), and a linear actuator chosen from the catalog. We were then asked to design a frame/mechanism to lift the maximum possible weight to the highest possible height, assuming all the supports and bar/actuator are rigid.

I used the greatest force actuator along with the longest for the most force.
