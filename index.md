## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpeg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is Yanna Mei, and I am a student at Cornell University intending to major in Civil Engineering. I am interested in learning more about structural engineering to, hopefully, one day work on designing safe buildings in natural disaster-prone areas. 

My passion lies with structural design and natural disaster mitigation. In a world with rapid climate change, many areas need new designs and further modifications in order to keep their buildings safe and fail-proof during a storm, tornado, earthquake, etc. I hope to one day travel to high risk places and underserved communities to build structures that will withstand the elements.
